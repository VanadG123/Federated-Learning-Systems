# Federated-Learning-Systems

Developed a comprehensive federated learning system using Flower and PyTorch across three interconnected modules. Implemented a federated server application (FL_server_app.py) with custom metric aggregation and FedAvg strategy, created a client application (FL_client_app.py) for model training and evaluation, and designed a task module (FL_task.py) including a CNN model, data loading, and training routines. This system facilitates distributed training and evaluation of machine learning models, optimizing performance in a federated learning environment.
